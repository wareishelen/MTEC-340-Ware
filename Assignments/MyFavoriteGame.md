# Red Dead Redemption

## Why is Red Dead Redemption my favorite video game? 
It doesn't necessarily fill that category for any particular reason other than it was the first. I have played games since with better graphics, a more insightful storyline and narrative, and better gameplay, but it is a really important game to me. At the time before playing it, I was never truly *into* gaming. My brothers played a lot of RPGs that I watched in passing, but watching them play RDR was my first look into video games could not only be entertaining for the purpose of skill, but also narrative storytelling. And therefore it still has to be my favorite.
